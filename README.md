> **BYD Trip Stats** is a feature-complete Android analytics dashboard for BYD DiLink vehicles — built by a BYD Seal owner and running on production hardware. It currently operates via an MQTT telemetry bridge (Electro) and is architected so that a native DiLink integration would require minimal changes.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- A BYD vehicle with **DiLink 3.0** (tested on BYD Seal; should be compatible with Atto 3, Dolphin, and other DiLink-equipped models)
- An active **[Electro](https://electro.app.br)** subscription — this is the telemetry bridge that exposes vehicle data via MQTT
- Android **10 or higher** on the DiLink head unit

### Installation

1. Download the latest signed APK from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/angoikon/byd-trip-stats/releases) tab
2. On your DiLink unit, run the app - enable installation from unknown sources and follow the on-screen prompt to install
3. Launch BYD Trip Stats, grant permissions for saving data to your car's internal storage
4. On first launch, the initialization screen will guide you through selecting your BYD model and entering your Electro MQTT topic (find it in Electro → Integrations → MQTT)

### Known Limitations

- **Electro is required.** BYD Trip Stats currently receives telemetry via an MQTT bridge provided by the Electro app. A future native implementation would remove this dependency entirely — see the [Integration Roadmap](#%EF%B8%8F-integration-roadmap) below.
- The app runs exclusively while the DiLink unit is active. Background tracking outside the vehicle is not supported by design.

---

## ✨ Feature Overview

**Driving Intelligence**
- Fully autonomous trip detection via gear position events (D/R → P) — zero driver input required
- Session distance tracking independent of trip recording state
- Manual override with confirmation safeguards

**Real-Time Telemetry**
- Live motor RPM per driven axle and estimated power split (AWD only: front 160 kW / rear 230 kW proportional to total output)
- Battery SoH, cell voltage range, thermal min/max delta
- HV and 12V bus voltage, tyre pressures per wheel (bar / PSI / kPa)
- Gear state, speed, engine power, regen detection

**Range Projection Engine**
- Power-integrated consumption model (Wh/km) computed over a rolling 10 km window
- EMA smoothing with stabilisation warmup (first 2 km discarded)
- Four-tier fallback: live trip → historical speed bins → lifetime average → WLTP baseline
- WLTP upper bound prevents implausible projections during low-speed urban starts
- Compared continuously against BMS estimate with signed delta display

**Trip Management**
- Multi-field filtering: date range, distance, energy, duration, efficiency
- Six sort criteria with ascending/descending toggle
- Per-trip CSV and JSON export

**Analytics & History**
- Full per-trip storage: route, telemetry timeseries, computed statistics
- Daily / weekly / monthly / annual energy consumption views
- Up to 10 heatmap dimensions with crosshair bin-range interaction (9 universal + 1 AWD-exclusive torque-split map)
- OpenStreetMap route overlay with energy event markers, fully offline

**Reliability & Data**
- Room (SQLite) persistence with WAL, automated maintenance workers, and schema migrations
- Scheduled encrypted backup via Telegram bot or local filesystem
- Full database restore with integrity verification

## 🖼️ Visual Showcase

### I. Real-Time Dashboard

Adaptive layouts for both landscape and portrait orientations on the rotating infotainment screen, including full split-screen multi-app support. The UI palette mirrors the DiLink Ocean Series dark and light themes.

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Dashboard — Light Theme</b><br><img width="450" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-06 at 19 42 51" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398b67eb-280f-4978-a542-67e6f7f96143" /></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Dashboard — Dark Theme</b><br><img width="450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e16f41b0-febb-4e19-85f3-d74b0dfc5a27" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Split-Screen — Horizontal</b><br><img width="450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4275bb8-715d-478f-90cf-0c40870d4ee5" /></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Split-Screen — Vertical</b><br><img width="450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5b07c36-b524-44f4-908a-d566401331cd" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

---

### II. Range Projection & Efficiency

A proprietary power-integration algorithm computes realistic remaining range in real time — based on actual Wh/km consumption, not the BMS's static estimate. The projection self-calibrates across the trip using a rolling 10 km window with EMA smoothing, and is bounded by WLTP to prevent overcorrection during low-speed urban starts.

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Live Range Projection</b><br><img width="450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55189f86-d9be-4977-a9f3-98203d8fbe5b" /></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Consumption Trends</b><br><img width="450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49098879-dd97-4402-acd7-80816ed564d4" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

---

## 🗺️ Integration Roadmap

This application currently bridges to the vehicle via MQTT (using the Electro third-party service). That dependency exists because direct DiLink API access is not available externally. The architecture is designed as follows;

```
Phase 1 — Current (External MQTT bridge)
  Electro app → MQTT broker → BYD Trip Stats

Phase 2 — Preferred (Native DiLink system app)
  Vehicle CAN / Internal API → BYD Trip Stats (system-signed APK, no bridge)

Phase 3 — Full OEM integration
  Logic absorbed into DiLink firmware; UI surfaced as a native DiLink panel
```

**What changes between phases:** only the data source layer (`MqttClientManager` → `VehicleApiClient`). The ViewModel, Room persistence, all charts, range projection engine, and UI are source-compatible. The MVVM boundary was deliberately drawn to make this substitution a single-file change.

The competitive case for Phase 2/3 is straightforward:

| Capability | Current DiLink OEM | Competitor Benchmark | BYD Trip Stats |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trip range projection | BMS estimate only | Real-time consumption model (Tesla) | Power-integrated live projection |
| Consumption history | 50 km rolling window | Weekly / Monthly / Annual (BMW, Polestar) | Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Annual |
| Motor telemetry | Not exposed | Front/rear torque split live view (NIO) | Real-time RPM + power distribution |
| Battery granularity | SoC % only | Cell voltage, SoH, thermal ranges | Cell min/max voltage, SoH, thermal delta |
| Trip intelligence | Manual | Gear-event triggered (NIO) | Fully autonomous — gear position D/R/P |
| Trip filtering & sorting | Not available | Basic date filter | Multi-field filter + 6 sort criteria |
| Data export | Not available | Varies | CSV / JSON per trip |
| Data sovereignty | Cloud-dependent | Varies | 100% local, zero external calls |

---

## 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

- **Local-first:** 100% of telemetry and trip data stored on-device — no cloud, no third-party analytics
- **Zero outbound calls:** No tracking, no crash reporting, no telemetry leaving the vehicle
- **User-controlled backup:** Encrypted backups to a private Telegram bot or local storage, initiated manually or on a configurable schedule
- **GDPR-aligned by design:** No personal data is collected or transmitted

This architecture requires no modification to comply with EU data regulations.

## 📞 Contact & Proposal

I am an independent software engineer and BYD Seal owner based in Greece. I built this application because the gap between the Seal's hardware capability and its software experience was significant enough to solve myself. The application is feature-complete and running on production hardware today.

If you represent BYD's Smart Device or Product Strategy team, I am open to discussing:

**1. Native System Integration** — Porting the application as a DiLink system-signed APK, replacing the MQTT bridge with direct vehicle API access. This would deliver the full feature set to all DiLink-equipped BYD vehicles via OTA.

**2. Analytics Algorithm Licensing** — The range projection engine, trip intelligence logic, and consumption modelling are available for licensing into official BYD firmware or companion applications.

**3. Technical Collaboration** — A scoped engagement to evaluate, extend, or adapt this work for official roadmap integration.

For all other enquiries — bug reports, feature requests, community discussion — please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/angoikon/byd-trip-stats/issues).

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Shipped

- [x] Predefined vehicle configuration ✅ *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] Charging session tracking ✅ *(v1.2.0)*
- [x] Trip comparison view ✅ *(v1.2.0)*

### Planned (v1.3.0+)

- [ ] Battery degradation tracking — plot SoH over time across trips, trend line and projected future health
- [ ] Cost tracking — input electricity price, calculate cost per trip and per month from recorded kWh
- [ ] Recurring route detection — automatically group trips that share the same route (e.g. daily commute) and compare efficiency across instances
- [ ] Trip goals & personal bests — set a consumption target, track streaks, flag personal best efficiency on a known route
- [ ] Seasonal consumption analysis — automatic winter vs summer efficiency breakdown based on recorded trip history
- [ ] Web dashboard companion — browse trip history and charts on a desktop browser offline-first: upload your backup file, charts render locally, nothing leaves your device
- [ ] Heatmap: Tyre Pressure vs Consumption — correlates each wheel's pressure against instantaneous kWh/100 km; answers whether running slightly higher pressure measurably improves efficiency on your specific car and tyres
- [ ] Heatmap: SOC vs Regen Efficiency — shows at which charge levels the BMS throttles regenerative braking (expected near 100% SoC); empirically maps the BYD Seal's regen behaviour
- [ ] Heatmap: Speed vs Battery Temperature — sustained speed as X axis vs pack temperature rise; distinguishes motorway thermal load from stop-start urban load more cleanly than the existing Power vs Battery Temp map
- [ ] Heatmap: Cell Voltage Spread vs SOC — (cellVoltageMax − cellVoltageMin) on Y, SoC on X; a healthy pack is flat, a pack with a weak cell shows a characteristic divergence spike at low SoC — the same diagnostic BYD service technicians use

**Vote on features** by 👍 reacting to issues!

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **No offline charts** - Route maps require internet first time
2. **No trip editing** - Can't modify trip start/end times
3. **No cloud sync** - All data is local only

### Workarounds

- **Route not showing:** Check that GPS coordinates in MQTT are non-zero
- **Trip not auto-starting:** Verify auto-detection is ON, gear is D/R
- **Service not auto-starting:** Check Autostart permission (disable toggle at disable Autostart)

See [Issues](https://github.com/angoikon/byd-trip-stats/issues) for full list.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Does this work with other BYD EVs?
**A:** Potentially! Any car using Electro app should work. Tested on BYD Seal only.

### Q: Do I need Electro subscription?
**A:** Yes, currently. Even if you decide to use the external MQTT Broker, you still need to retrieve MQTT data from Electro.

### Q: Will this drain my car's 12V battery?
**A:** It uses your 12V which is always being charged via your high-voltage EV battery. Very minimal battery impact.

### Q: Can I use this without side-loading?
**A:** No. The ultimate goal is for BYD to implement it natively as part of the infotainment system, without the need to side-load.

### Q: Is my data secure?
**A:** Yes. All data stays on your device (or at your own external MQTT broker if you configured one). No analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising. The only outbound network traffic and only if you chose to is a) to your own MQTT broker and b) to your private encrypted telegram bot.

### Q: Can I export to Excel?
**A:** Export as CSV, then open in Excel, Google Sheets, etc.

### Q: Why is MQTT connection failing?
**A:** Check:
1. Electro is running and connected
2. MQTT credentials are correct
3. Internet connection is active
4. Broker URL has no `http://` or `https://` prefix
