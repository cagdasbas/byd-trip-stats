/**
 * Runs once per week in the background to:
 *
 *  1. Checkpoint the WAL file so the main .db is fully self-consistent
 *  2. VACUUM the database to reclaim space freed by deleted trips/points
 *  3. Thin raw data points for trips older than 3 months — keeps one point
 *     every 30 seconds instead of the full 1-10 second resolution
 *
 * The worker is registered as a unique periodic job ("db_maintenance") by
 * BydStatsApplication on first launch. Using KEEP policy means a second
 * registration (e.g. after an app update) leaves the existing schedule intact.
 *
 * Why silent / no user interaction:
 *   VACUUM is a purely mechanical compaction step — the user has no meaningful
 *   choice to make. Surfacing it as a UI option adds complexity for zero benefit.
 *   The thinning only removes raw point density on old trips; trip-level stats
 *   (distance, energy, efficiency) live in TripEntity/TripStatsEntity and are
 *   completely unaffected.
